# React + TypeScript + Vite + bunch of other tools and libraries

There is certain assumption that you already have npm/yarn/pnpm and nvm/node installed on your machine. I will not describe how to install that.


When you clone the project, please run `npm i` from the project directory.

When instalation is done you can simply run it in terminal from the project directory by running `npm run dev`

to build the project locally just run `npm run build`

If you change the code and not sure if everything is correct, you can run `npm run lint`
